# License & Compliance (GPLv3+) – Project License and Redistribution Obligations

## License Overview

The spisocketswin32 project is distributed under the GNU General Public License, version 3 or any later version (GPLv3+). The repository root includes a complete copy of the GNU GPL v3, Version 3, 29 June 2007, governing use, modification, and redistribution of the software .

## Source File License Headers

Every C, C++, and header source file in this project begins with a standardized GPLv3+ header, as defined in the `spi.licenseheader` template. This header asserts author copyright and grants permission under GPLv3 or later:

```c
/*
 * Copyright (c) 2010-2023 Stephane Poirier
 *
 * This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
 * it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
 * the Free Software Foundation; either version 3 of the License, or
 * (at your option) any later version.
 *
 * This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
 * but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; ...
 * You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
 * along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

```

## Redistribution Obligations

When distributing this software (in source or binary form), you must:

- **Include the GPL license text**

Supply recipients with a copy of the `LICENSE` file containing the full GPLv3 text .

- **Provide Corresponding Source**

If you distribute binaries, you must either:

- Accompany them with the complete corresponding source code, or
- Provide a written offer, valid for at least three years, to supply the source on request, in accordance with GPL § 6 .

- **Retain and Propagate Notices**

Preserve all copyright and license notices in each source file (GPL § 4), and carry prominent notices of modification and date in any changed files (GPL § 5) .

- **License Derivative Works Under GPLv3+**

Any work based on or incorporating spisocketswin32 must be licensed as a whole under GPLv3 or later (no sublicensing or additional restrictions) .

- **No Additional Restrictions**

You may not impose further restrictions on recipients’ exercise of GPL rights (GPL § 10) .

## Implications for Distributing Binaries and Modified Versions

- Distributors of binaries must ensure recipients can obtain complete source code under the same GPLv3+ terms.
- Modified versions must be clearly marked, with changelog dates, and must include the same license header template.
- Any aggregated works must treat spisocketswin32 components under GPLv3+; aggregation does not extend GPL requirements to unrelated code.

By adhering to these obligations, you respect the freedoms and protections the GPLv3+ grants to all users and contributors.
